# Final Thoughts 

The last couple of weeks have moved very quickly and i am behind. This app gave good insight into creating an application using the MVC framework. I need to increase my understanding of ORM and using the framework effectivly. I plan to go over the previous weeks work intensly over the next few weeks.
